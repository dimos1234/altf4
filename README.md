A very basic programming language that uses a python-based compiler &amp; text exitor. The programming language has 2 integer variables, and a print function.
The 2 variable names are VAR1 and VAR2, which you can assign any integer to.
To print a string, write the following:<br/>
print "__your phrase__"
<br/>
to print VAR1 or VAR2:<br/>
print VAR1
print VAR2
