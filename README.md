A very basic programming language that uses a python-based compiler &amp; text exitor. The programming language has 2 integer variables, and a print function.
The 2 variable names are VAR1 and VAR2, which you can assign any integer to.
To print a string, write the following:
print "__your phrase__"

to print VAR1 or VAR2:
print VAR1
print VAR2
